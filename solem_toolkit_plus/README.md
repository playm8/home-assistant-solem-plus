> **Parallel fork of [hcraveiro/Home-Assistant-Solem-Toolkit](https://github.com/hcraveiro/Home-Assistant-Solem-Toolkit)**  
> New domain: `solem_toolkit_plus` ‚Äî can be installed alongside the original!

Integrate Solem Watering Bluetooth Controllers (tested on BL-IP & LR-IP4) into Home Assistant, **without LoRa gateway** or cloud.  
This fork brings more robust connection handling, better logging, and soon: full device setup via UI and status feedback.
